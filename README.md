# Tadiparthi_CSCI2275_FinalProject

  In this project, I will be creating a program that will be dealing with the vaccinations of COVID. The program will take in a population, and based on the avialability of the vaccine, it will output the how long it will take for eveyone in a said place to be vaccinated. This is based on the number of places that the vaccinations are given, whom, and how often they are given to. This program also considers the amount of vaccines used as well as the amount of vaccinations needed for the remaining population.
